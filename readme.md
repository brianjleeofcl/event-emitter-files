# Node.js Event Emitter

These files are used as demonstration for [my blog post on event emitters](https://medium.com/@brianjleeofcl/what-they-probably-didnt-teach-you-pt-1-node-js-event-emitters-observer-pattern-7dd02b67c061).

## Installation

After installing dependencies through npm, run TypeScript with command `$ ./tsc`. Then, run the code in `transpiled/main.js` through node.

i.e., 
```shell
$ ./tsc
$ node transpiled/main.js
```
